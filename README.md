# MA705 Individual Project
# Robel Hagos

This repository contains the .csv file, the .py file and other files used for the dashboard.

# Dashboard Description
This dashboard shows a comparison of the carbon dioxide emission of U.S and the entire Africa continent. It also shows a comparison of the population of U.S and Africa continent. The main goal of this dashboard is to show how one country emits way more C02 compared to an entire continent despite having less population, leading to both suffering the same consequences -Global Warming. Users can see the comaprison by choosing a decade of their interest from 1980-2020. The dashboard also shows how the annual global CO2 part per million has been changing over the decades.

# Data Sources
I have used 4 data sources for this project. I have narrowed down the publicly availabe dataset to just Africa and the U.S since those were the points of interest of this project. I have also incorporated data like population from other sources and combined them into one master python dataframe. I have included the final .csv file in this repo. The data sources I have used are listed below:

https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions - data about CO2 emission
https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html - data about annual mean CO2 PPM
https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/population - data about U.S population
https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/AFR/africa/population - data about African population
